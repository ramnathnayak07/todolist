# to-do list

This is a simple, user-friendly To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently, including adding, editing, marking tasks as completed, and deleting them. The app uses the browser's LocalStorage to save tasks, so tasks persist even when the page is reloaded.

## Features

- **Frontend**: A clean and stylish contact form interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend API**: Handles form submissions, performs basic validation, and stores data in an SQLite database.
- **API Integration**: The frontend interacts with the Flask backend via a RESTful API.
- **Database**: Data is persisted using SQLite, but this can be configured to any relational database.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS3: Used for styling the app, including flexbox and grid for layout.
- JavaScript: Adds functionality to the app, including dynamic task management and interaction with LocalStorage.
- Google Fonts: Provides custom fonts for better UI/UX.

- Deleting a Task.
- Click the "Delete" button next to the task.

## LocalStorage

The app leverages the browser's LocalStorage to store tasks. This allows users to:

- Save their tasks persistently in the browser.
- Retrieve tasks automatically when they revisit the page.

How it works:
- When tasks are added, updated, or deleted, the tasks are stored as JSON objects in the LocalStorage.
- On page load, the stored tasks are retrieved and displayed.

## Future Improvements

- User Authentication: Introduce user login to allow synchronization of tasks across devices.
- Task Priorities: Add functionality to prioritize tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
- Due Dates: Enable setting due dates and reminders for tasks.
- Task Filters: Provide filters to show tasks based on categories or completion status.
- Animations and Transitions: Add visual feedback for better user experience when tasks are added, edited, or deleted.
